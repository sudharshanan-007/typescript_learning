Exercise 1: Basic Abstract Class

Create an abstract class Shape with:
  An abstract method calculateArea(): number
  A constructor that takes color as a property
  A method getColor(): string that returns the color
  Then, create two subclasses Circle and Rectangle that implement calculateArea().
 
Task
  Implement Shape, Circle, and Rectangle
  Create instances and call the methods


Answer : 

abstract class Shape {
  constructor(protected color: string) {}

  abstract calculateArea(): number;

  getColor(): string {
    return this.color;
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  constructor(color: string, private radius: number) {
    super(color);
  }

  calculateArea(): number {
    return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
  }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
  constructor(color: string, private width: number, private height: number) {
    super(color);
  }

  calculateArea(): number {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}

// Testing
const circle = new Circle("Red", 5);
console.log(circle.getColor(), "Area:", circle.calculateArea());

const rectangle = new Rectangle("Blue", 4, 6);
console.log(rectangle.getColor(), "Area:", rectangle.calculateArea());


Exercise 2: Implementing an Interface

Create an interface Vehicle with:
    A property speed: number
    A method move(): void
    Then, implement Vehicle in two classes: Car and Bicycle.
 
Task: 
    Implement Vehicle, Car, and Bicycle
    Create instances and call the move() method

Answer : 

interface Vehicle {
  speed: number;
  move(): void;
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
  constructor(public speed: number) {}

  move(): void {
    console.log(`Car is moving at ${this.speed} km/h`);
  }
}

class Bicycle implements Vehicle {
  constructor(public speed: number) {}

  move(): void {
    console.log(`Bicycle is moving at ${this.speed} km/h`);
  }
}

// Testing
const car = new Car(80);
car.move();

const bicycle = new Bicycle(20);
bicycle.move();

Exercise 3: Combining Abstract Class and Interface

Create an interface Flyable with:
    A method fly(): void
    Create an abstract class Bird with:
    A property name: string
    A method eat(): void
Then, create two classes Eagle and Sparrow that extend Bird and implement Flyable.
 
Task: 
Implement Bird and Flyable
Create Eagle and Sparrow and call eat() and fly()

Answer : 

interface Flyable {
  fly(): void;
}

abstract class Bird {
  constructor(protected name: string) {}

  eat(): void {
    console.log(`${this.name} is eating`);
  }
}

class Eagle extends Bird implements Flyable {
  fly(): void {
    console.log(`${this.name} is flying high`);
  }
}

class Sparrow extends Bird implements Flyable {
  fly(): void {
    console.log(`${this.name} is flying low`);
  }
}

// Testing
const eagle = new Eagle("Eagle");
eagle.eat();
eagle.fly();

const sparrow = new Sparrow("Sparrow");
sparrow.eat();
sparrow.fly();


Exercise 4: Interface Inheritance

Create two interfaces:
    Person with name: string and speak(): void
    Employee (extends Person) with salary: number and work(): void
    Create a class Developer that implements Employee.
 
Task
    Implement Person, Employee, and Developer
    Create an instance and call speak() and work()

Answer : 

interface Person {
  name: string;
  speak(): void;
}

interface Employee extends Person {
  salary: number;
  work(): void;
}

class Developer implements Employee {
  constructor(public name: string, public salary: number) {}

  speak(): void {
    console.log(`${this.name} says hello!`);
  }

  work(): void {
    console.log(`${this.name} is coding`);
  }
}

// Testing
const dev = new Developer("Alice", 70000);
dev.speak();
dev.work();


=========================================================================

Advanced example
 
Exercise 1: Abstract Class for Banking System

Create an abstract class BankAccount with:
 
Protected properties: accountNumber, balance

Constructor to initialize accountNumber and balance

Methods:

deposit(amount: number): void (increases balance)

Abstract method withdraw(amount: number): boolean (returns true if successful, false otherwise)

Method getBalance(): number

Then, create two subclasses SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount that:
 
Implement withdraw()

SavingsAccount should have a withdrawal limit

CheckingAccount should allow overdraft up to a certain limit

Tasks

Implement BankAccount, SavingsAccount, and CheckingAccount

Create instances and test deposit/withdraw functions

Exercise 2: Interface for Payment System

Create an interface PaymentMethod with:
 
A method pay(amount: number): void

A method refund(amount: number): void

Then, create three classes CreditCard, DebitCard, and UPI that:
 
Implement PaymentMethod

Each class should have a balance and implement pay() and refund()

Tasks

Implement PaymentMethod, CreditCard, DebitCard, and UPI

Create instances and simulate payments & refunds

Exercise 3: Combining Abstract Class and Interface

Create:
 
Abstract class PaymentGateway with:
 
A method processPayment(amount: number): void

A method processRefund(amount: number): void

An abstract method validateTransaction(transactionId: string): boolean

Interface SecurePayment with:
 
Method authenticateUser(userId: string): boolean

Then, create a class PayPal that:
 
Extends PaymentGateway

Implements SecurePayment

Implements validateTransaction() and authenticateUser()

Tasks

Implement PaymentGateway, SecurePayment, and PayPal

Create an instance of PayPal and test methods

Exercise 4: Multiple Interface Implementation

Create:
 
Interface Loan with applyForLoan(amount: number): void

Interface Insurance with applyForInsurance(policy: string): void

Then, create a class Customer that:
 
Implements Loan and Insurance

Stores loan and insurance details in properties

Tasks

Implement Loan, Insurance, and Customer

Create an instance of Customer and test loan & insurance applications
